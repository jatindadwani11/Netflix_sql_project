![Netflix Logo](https://github.com/jatindadwani11/Netflix_sql_project/blob/main/logo.jpg)

## 📝 Overview
This project explores and analyzes Netflix’s catalog of movies and TV shows using **PostgreSQL**. The dataset includes comprehensive metadata such as title, director, cast, country, release year, rating, duration, and description. Through a series of SQL queries, we extract insights and trends to better understand content distribution, genre popularity, and viewing patterns.

## 🎯 Objective
- Analyze the structure and trends of content available on Netflix.
- Use PostgreSQL to extract meaningful insights from a real-world dataset.
- Practice SQL concepts such as filtering, aggregation, date handling, pattern matching, and subqueries.
- Draw conclusions about content types, countries, genres, and actor involvement.
